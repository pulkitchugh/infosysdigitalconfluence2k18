-Business Objective - The objective is to detect fraudulent transactions which is essential for banks so that customers are not charged for something they haven't purchased. It's necessary to retain customers and maintain brand value of the bank.

- Firstly we should give some insight into type of credit card fraud and describe which one we are trying to solve, i'll update this with that content soon.
-Unbalanced data can be overcomed by SMOTE technique (Working on this only)

-Anomaly detection

-Our whole proposed solution should revolve around "THE Business Proft or LOSS minimization". Everything we propose should in a way that it can 
benifit the business involved.

-Uniqueness of our proposed model should be highlighted, backed by some ground work (Research paper/ Self Exploration)

-Assumptions [Areas where our model will fail or drawback of our model should also be mentioned in a more subtle manner]

- we shoild never say that our model is complete we should delibrately point out some problem in the model whose solution we can implent showing future work 
we can do on the model.

-Problem exploration from a different angle, deep research, thought given to the corner cases as well

-Model drawbacks should be covered up by highlighting some suggested security patches, emphasising that the need of fraud detection arises only when the security is breached in the first place.
