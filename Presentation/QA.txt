Q1. Fraudsters change tactics when they notice that old tactics aren't working anymore: How do you make sure that you are handling these cases effectively?
A1. By encapsulating the behaviour behind new attack vectors constantly.(how to implement this?) NOTE DATA ALWAYS LEAVES TRAIL WE'LL EXPLOIT THAT     Our model is self trained periodically to gather new patterns that are popping up in the transction and thus if the fraudsters indulge in new trick then our model will be able to observe that trend in the data and we can act accoudingly.Moreover the techniques we use in our model has enavled it to train it very fast as a result the newly learnt pattern can be deployed in no time.
